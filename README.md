# Traveling-Salesperson-Circle-Heuristic
This repo showcases the progressive attempts at creating an algorithmic solution to the traveling salesperson problem using the Python programming language. 

The idea behind the algorithm is to combine the human intuition to draw a circle in response to the problem with a computer's ability to shuffle that circle into, hopefully, a global minimum. This strategy will likely not meet the qualifications of proving P = NP as I imagine the last step using a probabilistic shuffling that will not with 100% certainty deliver the correct result. However, if successful, it may drastically reduce the time needed to find an excellent approximation, as the initial step eliminates a huge number of options in the phase space given the number of solutions that contain a crisscross vastly outnumbers those that don't. Additionally, the intuition to create the most circular object is supported by the definition of a circle which states that it is the object with the greatest area-to-perimeter ratio and can be generalized to higher dimensions (sphere/hypersphere) for datasets that are more complex than 2D positions.
